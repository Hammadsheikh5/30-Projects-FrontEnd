# Day 4: Number Guessing Game

## Description
An app that generates random numbers to guess and play.

## Functionalities
- Start, pause, and guess the number.
- Try again and see the number of guess attempts.

## Overview of the Mini Next.js Application
Our Number Guessing Game application allows users to:
- Start the game to generate a random number.
- Pause and resume the game.
- If you pause and resume, a new random number is generated. ❌ *(This behavior is not supported.)*
- If you keep guessing without pausing, the number remains the same. ✅
- If the game ends and you restart, a new number is generated. ✅
